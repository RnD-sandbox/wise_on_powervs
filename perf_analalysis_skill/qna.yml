      To identify bottlenecks, perform the following steps:
      1. Identify the nodes with the least and most number of cpus.
      2. Identify the nodes with the least and most amount of memory.
      3. Check whether the values fulfill the following four criteria:
        1. min cpu >= (max cpu / 2)
        2. min memory >= (max memory / 2)
        3. min cpu > 0. Every node has at least one cpu assigned to it.
        4. min memory > 0. Every node has at least 1MB of RAM assigned to it.

      The system is only good if all four criteria are met.

      Let's analyze this system:
      1. Identify the nodes with the least and most number of cpus:
        min cpu = 0
        max cpu = 48
      2. Identify the nodes with the least and most amount of memory:
        min memory = 204484
        max memory = 409200
      3. Check if the system fulfills the four criteria:
        1.  0 ?>= (48 / 2)
            0 !>= 24
            The system does not meet criteria 1 because the cpu distribution between the nodes is unbalanced.
        2.  204484 ?>= (409200 / 2)
            204484 !>= 204600
            The system does not meet criteria 2 because the memory distribution is unbalanced.
        3.  0 !> 0
            The system does not meet criteria 3 because two nodes don't have any cpus assigned to them.
        4.  204484 > 0
            The system meets criteria 4.
      Summary: The system is not good. Two nodes don't have cpus assigned. Additionally, the memory distribution is
      unbalanced. Therefore, performance bottlenecks are expected.
    question: Is this a good or a bad NUMA configuration?

            The system meets criteria 3.
        4.  594829 > 0
            The system meets criteria 4.
      Summary: The system is not good since the memory distribution is unbalanced. Therefore, performance bottlenecks
      are expected.
